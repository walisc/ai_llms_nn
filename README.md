# Machine Learning and AI Foundations

This project is a companion to a blog series on Machine Learning and AI foundations. It builds knowledge from the ground up on how neural networks and AI (Large Language Models in particular) work.

## Learning Path

We build knowledge progressively, starting with Deep Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and lastly Large Language Models

## Implementation Approaches

To familiarize yourself with various concepts, each topic is approached from first principles. Rather than jumping straight to implementations using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), we start with vanilla implementations.

For example, neural network models can be trained using implementations from different approaches:

1. Vanilla Python (standard library only)
2. Python + NumPy
3. PyTorch
4. TensorFlow

See each package directory for instructions on running the various implementations.

## Contributing

This is an open-source project and contributions are welcome. 

**Bug Fixes:** Please create a pull request explaining the bug, how you fixed it, and how you tested it.
